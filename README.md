## 🎬 Movie database analysis with SQL (PostgreSQL).

## 📌 Description.
This project uses a movie database (Sakila type) to answer key business questions related to customers, rentals, most popular movies, revenue, etc. The queries were performed in PostgreSQL via pgAdmin 4.

## 🗃️ Database structure.
The database contains multiple tables such as:
- film: movie information (title, duration, replacement cost).
- rental: rental history
- customer: customer information
- payment: payments made
- inventory: availability by store
- category, actor, address, etc.

## ❓ Key questions analyzed
1. What are the most rented movies?
2. Which actors appear in the most films?
3. What is the revenue generated by each store?
4. Which customers have rented the most movies?
5. What is the total revenue per movie category?
6. Which movies have the highest replacement cost and are worth renting?
7. What is the average length of movies per category?
8. What days of the week have the most rentals?
9. What percentage of active customers generate the most revenue?
10. What is the average time between rental date and return?

## 💻 Technologies Used
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin 4
- SQL (JOINs, aggregations, subqueries, CTEs)

## 📂 Project files
- queries.sql: all SQL queries with explanatory comments
- dataset_info.md: explanation of tables and relations 
- images/: screenshots of the results in pgAdmin 

## 📈 Featured results
- The most profitable category is “Sports”.
- The most frequent customers are in the city of “Aurora”.
- The movies with the highest replacement cost are not always the most rented. 
- Tuesdays and Sundays have more rentals, which may support marketing decisions.

## 📚 Conclusions.
The analysis allowed us to identify consumption patterns and opportunities to improve the rental and pricing strategy. SQL is ideal for extracting valuable insights from complex relational databases like this one.
